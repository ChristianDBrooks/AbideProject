# AbideProject

### Description

A tool for Christians to help encourage their walk with the Lord. The App attempts to detect when a believer may be straying from the Lord and call them back to his grace and glory. 
* Allows users to enter daily journals (notes) on their studies/talks with Christ. 
* Answer a survey of questions to help the user meditate on patterns in their life, to try to assess what they’re doing that is healthy, and what is not healthy. How they can change this.
    * How would you say your relationship with Christ has been?
    * What have you been spending the most time doing today? Now compare that to how much time you’ve been spending with Christ? Are you happy with how you spent your time?
    * What is God teaching you?
    * What are you struggling with?
    * What can you ask Christ to give you grace for?
    * What can you repent for?
    * What can you ask Christ to help you with?
    * What did you read today?
    * What have you been consuming? Is it healthy or not?
* Tracks how often a user engages with the app.
* When a user is disengaged the app sends notifications calling the user back to Christ and encourages them in mindful patterns instead of dying to the material things of the world.
